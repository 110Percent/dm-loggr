# dm-loggr

**MAKING A README AT NIGHT WHILE SLEEP-DEPRIVED IS FUN WOOOO**

You gotta like, start the app with `node dm-loggr.js`
Then it auto-generates config files! Magic!
Then you pop your token into `./utils/config.js`
Then run the same command AGAIN!
Once you see `Signed In` in the console, go to `localhost:2793/logs/USERID` in your browser, replacing USERID with the ID of the user you want to check up on logs for.
REMEMBER: This tool only logs messages while the tool is running!
